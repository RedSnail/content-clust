unsupervised cells clustering is one of the biggest challenge in scRNAseq data analysis. 
Modern clustering methods are different approaches of clustering of nodes in linear space, without analysing of relationships between genes.
Here we try to develop methods based on how are quantities of cells expressing paticular gene relate to each other.
